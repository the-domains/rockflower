The Five Keys provide a holistic approach to addressing the most critical challenges facing women and girls as well as societies and humanity itself - challenges such poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, warfare and lack of education.  The Five Keys, which directly address each of these challenges, provide the essential framework for all investment in our partner programs and measurement of impact and success.

The Five Keys are:

* [Peace and Security][0]
* [Access to Food and Water][1]
* [Maternal and Reproductive Health][2]
* [Education][3]
* [Financial Independence][4]

Rockflower seeks to be the gardener that works to connect those working within and around The FIVE KEYS by providing a connecting platform to share funds, expertise, proven techniques and shared resources. It does this through utilizing a strategy of partnership and collaboration to fertilize and encourage depth of impact.
